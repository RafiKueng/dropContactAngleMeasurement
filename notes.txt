PROJECT: drop C ontact A ngle M easurement



Time management / planning:

- 22.2.: test in the lab, on the lab computer with actual measurement.
- 27.2.: program should be basically running, with basic gui or console
- 5.3.: deadline for finished program and gui, beta tested and fully documented.
I didn't keep track of the detailed, actual hours spent on the project, but I supppose I'm around 50-60, I expect ca. 20 more needed...

Design Details:

- principle: easy to use:
 * intuitive gui
 * produce publishable results / plots on the fly
 * easy data export to excel, matlab, ...

- easy to extend: plug in based design. Easy addition of
 * other data sources (other lab devices)
 * processing routines 
 * output capabilities
 * in c/c++ and python, possibly matlab, IGOR

- languages:
 * gui & basic program in python
 * speed critical parts in C / C++ (using opencv library)

- design principles:
 * all in one: no need for external tools
 * multi threaded for speed
 * life / lab working mode (see life results)
[* real time measurement mode (analyse while recording with full precession)]
 * off line / office working mode: process recorded data streams
